As one of the most influential social movements in recent years, \#MeToo has enabled sexual harassment to rise to the surface that usually does not get the attention required. There are various types of sexual harassment such as verbal, physical or non-verbal issues in real life and unfortunately, those are some of the most under-reported criminal offenses. Most victims may not be willing to go to the police or reveal these issues on social media or even people around, although they are affected mentally or physically or both. The reasons for this can be manifold. One of the reasons can be, for example, the feeling of shame or embarrassment

In this nonprofit text mining project, \#MetooMaastricht, we aim to help sexual harassment victims in the city of Maastricht, the Netherlands. Therefore, we come up with the idea of an intelligent tool, namely a chatbot, which can retrieve crucial information from victimsâ€™ texts such as the types of harassment as well as the time and location of the event in order to suggest the best set of actions. 

Bearing in mind the previous studies against sexual harassment and text mining techniques; our main research questions were as follows:

>>> How can we best design and implement an intelligent chatbot in order to advise people affected by harassment  cases?
>>> How can we successfully classify different types of harassment cases based on short texts by using text classification techniques?
>>> Can we extract time and location information from these texts?
>>> How can we use the information extracted  from our models in our final product, a chatbot, for proper guidance to victims?
