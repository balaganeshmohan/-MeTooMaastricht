#About
In this project we try to leverage natural language procesing to help victims of sexual harrasment in the city of Maastricht. This project is a part of my master course work and was done along with 4 other students and professor as our guide. We aim to create a medium through which people could share their misfortunate events in a non judgemental environment. The idea is to create a chatbot that can understand user input related to the event and classify what type of event the user underwent and reply with appropriate information. The bot will not be self contained meaning it can only understand certain thing related to events since the training data was limited. 


Bearing in mind the previous studies against sexual harassment and text mining techniques; our main research questions were as follows:

>>> How can we best design and implement an intelligent chatbot in order to advise people affected by harassment  cases?
>>> How can we successfully classify different types of harassment cases based on short texts by using text classification techniques?
>>> Can we extract time and location information from these texts?
>>> How can we use the information extracted  from our models in our final product, a chatbot, for proper guidance to victims?
