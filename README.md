# About

In this project we try to leverage natural language procesing to help victims of sexual harrasment in the city of Maastricht. This project is a part of my master course work and was done along with 4 other students and professor as our guide. We aim to create a medium through which people could share their misfortunate events in a non judgemental environment. The idea is to create a chatbot that can understand user input related to the event and classify what type of event the user underwent and reply with appropriate information. The bot will not be self contained meaning it can only understand certain thing related to events since the training data was limited.

## Data

The training data for positive class was accquired from [here](https://www.safecity.in/). For negative class, random text from around the internet that does not relate to out problem was used.
